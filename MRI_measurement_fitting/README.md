Script for depth and shape analysis of atomic layers from secondary ion mass spectroscopy data.

Its purpose was to determine whether signal from an embedded element corresponds to a monolayer or an extended structure. Several approximations (infinitely thin layer, homogeneous layer of finite thickness etc.) can be evaluated. All are based on the atomic mixing depth - surface roughness - information depth model. The primary input axis needs to already be converted from time to depth in nanometers.
