# numerical-utilities

A collection of poorly written code snippets for numerical computing and data analysis which would otherwise be forgotten about. Documentation is a work-in-progress (as much as I would like to say the code is self-documenting, that is far from true).

More information on the scripts can be found in their respective subfolders.
